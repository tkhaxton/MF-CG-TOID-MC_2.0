CONTENTS/USAGE
--------------

monolayer

   Performs a Monte Carlo search over 44 degrees of freedom to find a low-energy
   monolayer configuration

   Selected options:
      -inputfile (optional): Monolayer configuration file (if no inputfile is
         given, the code first solves for a low-energy configuration of a single
         peptoid chain)
      -base: Directory for output files
      -chemistry: Series of integers denoting the sequence(s) of the peptoids.
         For a monodisperse collection of N block-4n peptoids, the syntax is:
            -chemistry 1 1 N 2 1 2 n 3 n
      -interchainspacing: Initial spacing between parallel chains in angstroms
      -temperature: Fictitious temperature in K used in the Monte Carlo search
      -cycles: Number of Monte Carlo cycles

   Inputs:
      <inputfile> (optional)

   Outputs:
      <base>/c<cycles>.cg.xyz: Time series of coarse-grained coordinates in XYZ
         format, recorded each time the Monte Carlo search finds a new lowest
         energy configuration.  Load in VMD Tk Console with 
         "mol new c<cycles>.cg.xyz".
      <base>/c<cycles>.cg.vmd.source: VMD Tcl script for loading bonds, colors,
         and radii of coarse-grained coordinates.  After loading XYZ file, run
         Tcl script with "source c<cycles>.cg.source".

      <base>/c<cycles>.allatom.source: VMD Tcl script for all-atom coordinates

         system size does not have to match the system size of <inputfile>
      -firstx -lastx -xspace -firsty -lasty -yspace -firstz -lastz -zspace:
         Parameters defining the rectilinear grid.  x parameters are in units of
